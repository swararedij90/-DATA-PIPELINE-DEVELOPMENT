## üìÅ Project Description
This project, titled ‚ÄúEfficient Data Cleaning and Transformation Pipeline using Python and Pandas,‚Äù focuses on one of the most critical aspects of data science ‚Äî data preprocessing. As part of my internship under Codetech IT Solutions, I was tasked with building a modular and reusable data pipeline that could automatically clean, transform, and prepare raw data for downstream analysis or machine learning tasks.
Objective:
In real-world data science applications, raw data is often messy, inconsistent, and incomplete. This task aimed to simulate such a scenario by using a sample dataset containing missing values, incorrect formats, and inconsistencies. My objective was to use Python and relevant libraries to build a pipeline that performs:
Data cleaning (handling nulls, duplicates, format issues)
Data transformation (creating derived fields, renaming columns, reformatting)
Saving the final cleaned data for further analysis.

Tools and Technologies Used
To implement this task effectively, I utilized a range of tools and technologies:
Programming Language:
Python was used as the primary programming language because of its simplicity, readability, and the wide range of powerful data manipulation libraries it offers.
Python Libraries:
pandas: For reading, transforming, cleaning, and saving the dataset. Pandas provides powerful DataFrame structures that make it easy to manipulate tabular data.
numpy: Used for handling numerical operations and generating derived fields where necessary.
os: For handling file paths and automating directory navigation or creation.
Platform:
The entire project was executed on a Windows 10 system.
Editor/IDE Used:
I used Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for writing and running the Python scripts. VS Code‚Äôs user-friendly interface, integrated terminal, and extensions for Python development made it an ideal choice for working efficiently.

Project Workflow
The complete workflow was divided into modular steps:
Loading the Data:
The raw dataset was imported from a CSV file located in the dataset folder using pandas.read_csv().
Data Cleaning:
This step involved:
Dropping or imputing missing values
Removing duplicate records
Ensuring column consistency (data types, naming conventions)
Stripping unnecessary white spaces or symbols from string fields
Data Transformation:
Creating new columns like "age group" based on age
Normalizing or scaling numeric columns
Renaming columns for clarity
Encoding categorical variables if necessary
Exporting the Cleaned Data:
The final cleaned and processed dataset was saved as a new CSV file in the output folder using pandas.to_csv(). This file is ready for use in analytics or machine learning models.

Real-World Applications
This task simulates the exact type of work data scientists and analysts do in professional environments. Such a data pipeline is applicable in:
Business Intelligence: Cleaning raw sales or customer data before creating dashboards.
Healthcare Analytics: Processing patient data to prepare for machine learning disease detection models.
E-commerce: Preparing order and transaction logs for recommendation systems.
Banking: Transforming customer and transaction data before feeding it into fraud detection models.
Government and Research: Handling census or survey datasets for policy development or social studies.
